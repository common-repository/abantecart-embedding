= Do I need an SSL certificate for WordPress? =

HTTPS connection is required. SSL / HTTPS is an encryption method that secures the connection between users’ browser and your WordPress hosting server. This makes it harder for hackers to eavesdrop on the connection. If you're not sure whether your Wordpress or AbanteCart site has SSL, you can easily find out by checking the URL of the site. If it starts with HTTP, you aren't secure, and if it begins with HTTPS, then your website has an SSL certificate.
